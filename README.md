# LagosFirebaseCodelab
This repo contains the working and skeleton code for a realtime Android chat application developed with Firebase.

The master branch contains the full source code of the app with login and offline functionalities implemented while the skeleton branch has no functionality at all.

Please first update the strings.xml file by adding your own firebase url to the **firebase_url** string before running the project in Android Studio.
